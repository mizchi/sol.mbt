## Technical

### How does Luna compare to React?

| Aspect | React | Luna |
|--------|-------|------|
| Update Model | Virtual DOM diffing | Fine-grained signals |
| Hydration | Full page | Partial (islands) |
| Runtime Size | ~42KB | ~3KB |
| Language | JavaScript | MoonBit + JavaScript |

### What is Islands Architecture?

Islands Architecture is a pattern where most of the page is static HTML, with only interactive "islands" loading JavaScript. This results in:

- Faster initial page load
- Smaller JavaScript bundles
- Better performance on low-end devices

### Can I use Luna with existing frameworks?

Luna is designed as a standalone solution. However, you can embed Luna islands in any HTML page.
